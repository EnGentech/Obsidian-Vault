Certainly! Here is a comprehensive table including all commonly used functions in the `unittest` module, along with their descriptions and sample code:

| Function             | Description                                                                                                     | Sample Code                                                                                               |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `unittest.main()`     | This function is used to run the tests from the command line. It collects all the test cases and runs them.       | ```python if __name__ == '__main__': unittest.main()```                                                   |
| `unittest.TestCase`  | This is a class that provides a base class for individual test cases. It provides various assertion methods to check for and report failures. | ```python class TestMyFunction(unittest.TestCase):```                                                  |
| `self.assertEqual()` | This method is used within a test case to check if the two given values are equal. It raises an exception if the values are not equal. | ```python self.assertEqual(result, expected_result)```                                                |
| `self.assertTrue()`  | This method is used to verify that a given condition is true. It raises an exception if the condition is false.  | ```python self.assertTrue(condition)```                                                                   |
| `self.assertFalse()` | This method is used to verify that a given condition is false. It raises an exception if the condition is true.  | ```python self.assertFalse(condition)```                                                                  |
| `self.assertRaises()` | This method is used to test whether a specific exception is raised. It is used within a test case to check if the expected exception is raised during the execution of the code block. | ```python with self.assertRaises(ExpectedException) as context:```                                      |
| `setUp()`             | This method is used to set up the necessary preconditions for the test. It is called before each individual test case. | ```python def setUp(self):```                                                                              |
| `tearDown()`          | This method is used to perform the necessary cleanup after the test. It is called after each individual test case. | ```python def tearDown(self):```                                                                           |
| `setUpClass()`        | This method is used to set up any state that is shared across all the test cases in a test class. It is called before any test cases are executed. | ```python @classmethod def setUpClass(cls):```                                                           |
| `tearDownClass()`     | This method is used to perform any necessary cleanup after all the test cases in a test class have been executed. It is called after all the test cases have been executed. | ```python @classmethod def tearDownClass(cls):```                                                        |
