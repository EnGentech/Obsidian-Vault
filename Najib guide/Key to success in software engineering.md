Set up some daily habits  
always plan your week ahead  
don't start your day by accident  
for example:  

-   practice typing on [keybr.com](http://keybr.com/)
-   do daily coding challenges on one of those website:

codewars, codeforce, hackerrank, leetcode, ...  

-   read articles 2 per day
-   a coding book per month
-   instead of taking notes, ask question , and try to answer them when you finished the leçon (active recalling)
-   put those questions on Anki (flash cards) and review them daily (spaced repetition)
-   use pomodoro technique to stay focus (25min work + 5 min of active pause - stretch)
-   after 1h or work (4 pomodoro) do a long pause 15min and go walk outside
